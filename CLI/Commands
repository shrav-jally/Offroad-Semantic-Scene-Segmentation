download train, test datasets and scripts and put them in project folder and navigate to it on cli and start prompting to train ur model

cd C:\Users\jalle\VSC\ANTIGRAVITY\Techtonic\Offroad_Segmentation_Scripts

cd ENV_SETUP

setup_env.bat

python train.py

what i should have done to avoid the slow training instead of 

pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

this installs the GPU version of PyTorch and drops the training time from 15 hours to 10-20 minutes
